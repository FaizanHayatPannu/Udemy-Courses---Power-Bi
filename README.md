# Udemy Top Performing Courses-Dashboard


## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps us understand the best perdorming courses based off some filters. I used slicers that filtered the data based off whether the courses are paid or not, level of difficulty, & subject. Some cards were present to show relevant information of filtered data. 

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present.
- Step 5 : An area chart was used ranking courses by number of reviews.
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for four fields named  'Paid','Level' & 'Subject'
- Step 8 : A bar chart was added to the report showing top courses by number of subscribers.
